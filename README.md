# Aptos-Project

Welcome to the **Rock Paper Scissors** game, now powered by the Aptos blockchain! This repository contains the smart contract code for a decentralized, transparent, and interactive Rock Paper Scissors game, leveraging the Aptos blockchain for a seamless user experience.

## Features

### **Blockchain-Based Fair Gameplay**
   - The game is decentralized and runs on the Aptos blockchain, ensuring transparent gameplay with provably fair results for each round.

### **Replay Anytime**
   - The game can be reset after each round using the `restart_game` function, allowing players to replay without redeploying the contract.

### **Randomized Computer Moves**
   - The computer opponent's moves are generated using Aptos' built-in randomness module, ensuring unpredictability in the game.

## How to Play

### Prerequisites
- **Aptos CLI**: Ensure you have the Aptos CLI installed on your local machine.
- **Aptos Wallet**: You will need an Aptos-compatible wallet such as Petra or Martian with some APT tokens for gas fees.

### Steps to Deploy and Play

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_github_name/Aptos-RockPaperScissors.git
    cd Aptos-RockPaperScissors
    ```

2. **Compile and Deploy** the smart contract:
    ```bash
    aptos move publish
    ```

3. **Interact** with the contract using the Aptos CLI, your wallet, or a blockchain explorer to play the game.

### Game Mechanics
1. **Start a Game**: Initialize the game by calling the `initialize_game` function.
2. **Make Your Move**: Choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors by invoking the `make_move` function.
3. **Computer Move**: The computerâ€™s move is automatically generated by the Aptos randomness module.
4. **Get the Result**: Use the `determine_game_result` function to reveal the winner (either you or the computer).
5. **Restart**: Players can reset the game for another round by calling `restart_game`.

## Smart Contract Functions

### Core Functions

- **initialize_game**: Begins a new game session by initializing player and game state.
- **make_move**: Allows the player to select their move (rock, paper, or scissors).
- **compute_computer_move**: The Aptos blockchain randomly selects a move for the computer.
- **determine_game_result**: This function compares both moves to determine the winner and updates the score.
- **restart_game**: Resets the game state, allowing the player to play another round.
